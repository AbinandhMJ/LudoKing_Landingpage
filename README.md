## Collaboration Guidelines

This project is a collaborative effort with six members. To ensure smooth collaboration, follow these guidelines:

- **Branching Strategy:** Create feature branches for each new feature or style enhancement. Use a consistent naming convention, such as `feature/your-feature` or `style/your-style`.
- **Pull Requests:** Before merging into the main branch, submit a pull request for review. Mention the relevant team members for style review.
- **Communication:** Use project boards, issues, and a designated communication channel (e.g., Slack) to stay in sync with other team members. Clearly communicate style choices and any challenges faced.
